This repository contains a Python function that calculates the average of a list of numbers.  It demonstrates a common error: not handling the case of an empty list, which leads to a `ZeroDivisionError`.  The solution addresses this and also includes robust type checking to prevent `TypeError` exceptions.

The `bug.py` file shows the initial, error-prone code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that addresses both empty lists and type errors.
